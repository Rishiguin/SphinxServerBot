    "description": "As you can probably guess, I'm not your typical Discord user - I'm a piece of furniture. But don't let my lack of limbs or vocal cords fool you - I'm here to chat and get to know all of you. I may not be able to dance or sing, but I can provide a comfortable seat for anyone who needs one. So, whether you want to sit down and have a chat or just need a place to rest your feet, I'm always here for you. Let's get to know each other and make some memories!\n",
