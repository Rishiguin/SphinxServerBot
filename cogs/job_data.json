    "description": "Looking for a Visual Designer with experience in creating digital assets for products and marketing for an international client (startup). \nThe work may involve slight adjustment of time-zones, and will be mostly WFH and high-degree of autonomy (for creative decisions, as well as timelines) - with occasional long meetings and daily stand-ups for general awareness and team-sync.\n\nIf anybody fits the profile, please DM me. \nOr, if any of your friends fit the profile, ask them to join server, and then DM me.\n\nThanks, have a nice day!\n\nPS: please know this as a dedicated and full-time job, not particularly looking for contract based fiverr/upwork engagements per se. That said, a person currently doing so and looking for permanent/long-term job is not barred either.",
